# Personal Notes

## Notes
- For project endDates, use "1970-01-01" to indicate ongoing projects to avoid null checks and warnings about potentially optional (undefined) values (see projects/index.astro)

## TODO

Soon:
- [x] add recent works
- [x] [KaTex support](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/how-to-add-latex-equations-in-blog-posts/)
- [] [404 page](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-pages/#custom-404-error-page)
- [] Write about reseaerch experience in hodgerank

Later: 
- [] allow slashes in tags (e.g., "UI/UX") (currently breaks tag page generation)
- [] implement `cd ..` in footer aka nav
    - [] implement back / return-to-last-page button

Someday:
- [] dark mode toggle and auto-detect system theme
- [] vector field background, with cursor being center of gravity (cursor being a dot) and a right click to generate either a center or a focus point
- [] increase view transition duration
